Blu-Dot.org is a vehicle for 'Global System Integration', which is the process conducted by 'Global System Integrators' to interconnect diverse component sub-systems of the planet into a single system then functioning as a co-ordinated whole. 

This process of integration then evolves such system to a superior level of all-round functioning. Examples of Global System Integration in operation include: 

- mapping the global-system, 

- identifying key "acupressure"-points of the global system (ie areas particularly significant to the functioning of such system), available for enhancement 

- connecting opposing or potentially complementary organisations, movements, & sectors, in those significant areas, 

- convening those players, 

- facilitating their interaction, 

- applying coaching, mediating, and other developmental & conciliation technologies as required, and 

- co-creating processes & structures which optimise future ongoing functioning of such players, the sub-systems & areas they operate in, and the overall global system
